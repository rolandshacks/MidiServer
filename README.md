## MidiServer ##

MidiServer is a simplified web server written in C# that features MIDI access through a JavaScript web interface.
The general idea was to provide a generic starting ground for building web/touch-based interfaces for MIDI devices.

Being more a demonstrator than a real-life application, it's focus also is on getting a mix of techniques to work:

 * C# and .Net with the Concurrent package
 * C# based web server with support for GET and POST requests
 * C# based, very simplistic component / service model
 * JavaScript / AJAX
 * JavaScript libraries for midi, system and rpc
 * JQuery and JQuery-UI
 * Automated data-binding using HTML, JavaScript and JQuery
